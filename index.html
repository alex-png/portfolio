                I am a Full-Stack software engineer seeking a front-end development position. The rest of this text is
                made
                up and
                nonsense for me to see what the nav bar will look at. HIRE ME!!

                She wondered if the note had reached him. She scolded herself for not handing it to him in person. She
                trusted her
                friend, but so much could happen. She waited impatiently for word.
                <br>
                I met a traveller from an antique land,
                Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
                Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
                The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
                And on the pedestal, these words appear:
                My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
                Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
                The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
